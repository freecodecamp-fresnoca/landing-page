# landing-page
This is the repo for the landing page for Free Code Camp Fresno, California. 

If you've attended a meetup and would like to work on it with us please comment on a relevant issue [here](https://github.com/freecodecamp-fresnoca/landing-page/issues) and jump in! We have opportunities to collaborate in all aspects of the site: written content, design, coding, deployment, you name it. If you get stuck, we'll help you figure it out.

We're in the process of moving a lot of our activities off of Facebook and meetup.com. It just makes more sense to run our group from our own website so that new coders can get real-world development experience as well as having a place to show off their latest projects.
