			<p><a href='https://freecodecamp.org' target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a> is a global organization for teaching real-world coding skills. This is the Fresno chapter website.</p>
			<p>All that is needed to join our meet up group is a motivation to learn or teach code and a computer that can connect to wifi. We recommend registering an account at freecodecamp.org and doing a few exercises first, but that's not required.</p>

			<p>Would you like to get involved but you're not sure where to begin? Email Michael Chrisco and Tom Klein at <a href='mailto:freecodecampfresno@gmail.com'>freecodecampfresno@gmail.com</a> and we'd be happy to talk!

			<p>We're moving away from Facebook and meetup.com at the moment. While it's a lot more work to build and maintain our own website, we think the opportunities it provides for members of our group to work with one another on code is just too important to set aside. That said, we're still checking up on those accounts.</p>
